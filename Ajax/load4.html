            <p>We can't wait to load up Barney, our <br> faithful bus, with the widest range of <br> toys we've ever taken on the road...
            <br><br>
            This year sees some impressive stats as <br> we will be bringing 15 team members, <br> 50km of cable, 50 arduino compatible <br> boards, 25 laptops, 20 tablets, 10 <br> mobile phones, 5 quadcopter kits, and a <br> giant laser strapped to the roof. <br><br>
            We're also bringing a big top, which will <br> provide shelter throughout the night as <br> well as housing talks and <br> demonstrations from an impressive <br> range of guest speakers <br><br>
            And yes, we did say that we have a giant <br> laser strapped to the root of the bus.<br>
            Let's see how often we get stopped for <br> speeding this time!
